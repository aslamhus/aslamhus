### Hi, I'm Aslam Husain 👋🏽

- 📷 I'm a photographer
- 🎭 A long time ago, in a galaxy far far away, an actor 
- 🧑‍💻 Part time coder since the early 2000s  
- 🌱 Currently learning websockets/service workers 

I've been a self taught web developer for about 15 years. My first foray into coding was in the 1990s with Macromedia's Director when I was about 10 years old. I was building very basic, very derpy RPGs inspired by Final Fantasy, accompanied by also very derpy 3D animations I made with Cinema4D. I would pass the games out to my friends in gradeschool via the 100 floppydisks it took to archive them. (Thankfully ZipDisk came along in '94 - 100 MB of storage, WHAT?!?). There was no youtube, no StackOverflow, and very little documentation available. So progress was... glacial. Now there are resoures to learn everywhere and I am always hungry to learn more!

I Love writing vanilla javascript, love the functional programming discipline of React, but also the OOP discipline of writing PHP classes. I am keen to learn more about lower level languages and improve my knowledge on Data Structures and Algorithms.

## Things I've built recently

I built a backup app for all my websites using Linux/Applescript with a progress bar that keeps me apprised of the backup processes (Archiving, rsyncing, etc). It also sends me an email report if the backup fails or is successful. 

## Languages and frameworks I use

- PHP
- Javascript
- React
- Webpack
- HTML
- CSS
- Linux
- Jquery
- MYSQL

## Passing familiarity with...

- Swift
- Java
- Applescript


## Skills I want to learn

- Typescript
- Python
- Node 
- C++
- Tensor Flow
