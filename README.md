### Hi, I'm Aslam 👋🏽


- 🧑‍💻 Part time coder since the early 2000s  
- 📷 Photographer
- 🎭 A long time ago, in a galaxy far far away, an actor 
- 🌱 Currently learning websockets/service workers 

I've been a self taught web developer for about 15 years. My first foray into coding was in the 1990s with Macromedia's Director when I was 10 years old. I was building very (VERY) basic, Final Fantasy inspired RPGs, accompanied by similarly earnest 3D animations I made with Cinema4D.  I would pass the games out to my friends in grade school via the 100 floppydisks 💾 it took to archive them. (Thankfully ZipDisk came along in '94 - 100 MB of storage, WHAT?!?). There was no YouTube, no StackOverflow, and very little documentation available. So progress was... glacial. Now the resources available for learning seem limitless and I am always hungry for more!

I was an actor and headshot photographer, but a musculo-skeletal disorder changed all that. Now I am putting all my resources into my love for technology 💻. I still do photography from time to time, check it out ➜ [aslamhusainphotography.com](https://aslamhusainphotography.com).

I Love writing **vanilla javascript**, love the functional programming of **React**, but also the OOP discipline of writing **PHP** classes! I am keen to learn more about lower level languages and improve my knowledge of **Data Structures and Algorithms**.

## Things I've built recently

### Backup applet
Most recently, I used **Linux/Applescript** to build an applet that automates the backup of all the websites on my server. A cron job runs the app every month. It shows a progress bar that keeps me apprised the backup status/progress (archiving directories, rsyncing, etc). Each backup/snapshot is organised by date and time, and I can customise the needs for each site with a .backupignore file. It also sends me an email report if the backup fails or is successful every month. 

### My first NPM package!
I use the File API a fair bit, so I decided to create a library/package I could reuse that selects, reads, and previews files. You can check it out here [@aslamhus/fileselect](https://github.com/aslamhus/fileselect)
