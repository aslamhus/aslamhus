### Hi, I'm Aslam 👋🏽


- 🧑‍💻 Part time coder since the early 2000s  
- 📷 Photographer
- 🎭 A long time ago, in a galaxy far far away, an actor 
- 🌱 Currently learning websockets/service workers 

I've been a self taught web developer for 15 years. My first foray into coding was in the 1990s with Macromedia's Director when I was 10 years old. I was building very (VERY) basic, Final Fantasy inspired RPGs, accompanied by similarly earnest 3D animations I made with Cinema4D.  I would pass the games out to my friends in grade school via the 100 floppydisks 💾 it took to archive them. (Thankfully ZipDisk came along in '94 - 100 MB of storage, WHAT?!?). There was no YouTube, no StackOverflow, and very little documentation available. So progress was... glacial. Now the resources available for learning seem limitless and I am always hungry for more!

I was an actor and headshot photographer, but a musculo-skeletal disorder changed all that. Now I am putting all my resources into my love for technology 💻. I still do photography from time to time, check it out ➜ [aslamhusainphotography.com](https://aslamhusainphotography.com).

I Love writing **vanilla javascript**, love the functional programming of **React**, but also the OOP discipline of writing **PHP** classes! I am keen to learn more about lower level languages and improve my knowledge of **Data Structures and Algorithms**.

## Things I've built recently

### Video Editor
I built a vanilla javascript video editor interface that can handle trimming and cropping videos in browser. While the editor doesn't perform the video manipulation it exports an object with user edits that can be sent to a server where these operations can be performed. You can see a work example here: [https://aslamhusain.com/video-editor/](https://aslamhusain.com/video-editor/)

### React Table Component
I other Table component libraries slick and beautiful but often limited in terms of functionality. I built my own Table component that handles operations like sorting, filtering, pagination and select and deleting rows.



### Backup applet
Most recently, I used **Linux/Applescript** to build an applet that automates the backup of all the websites on my server. A cron job runs the app every month. It shows a progress bar that keeps me apprised of the backup status/progress (archiving directories, rsyncing, etc). Each backup/snapshot is organised by date and time, and I can customise the needs for each site with a .backupignore file. It also sends me an email report if the backup fails or is successful every month. 

### My first NPM package!
I use the File API a fair bit, so I decided to create a library/package I could reuse that selects, reads, and previews files. You can check it out here [@aslamhus/fileselect](https://github.com/aslamhus/fileselect)

## Some of my recent web dev work


[Duende Management](https://www.duendemanagement.com)
A UK based Talent agency. Built with Wix. I loved using Wix's javascript framework **Velo** to create an automated display of all the agency's actors. The client is able to update photos, description and stats for each actor without having to touch the design. 

[Kate Novak](https://katenovak.co.uk/)
A UK based voice over artist. Built with Wordpress. I loved creating two different custom audio players using HTML5 and javascript.
